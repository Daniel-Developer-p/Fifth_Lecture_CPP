# Fifth-Lecture-CPP



what we will learn:
- 
- something new and interesting
- A LOT OF MEMORY
- Bubble Algorithm ```pop```
- Little OOP

# Homework
Implement (or copy) sorting algorithms and apply to the array that we read during the class work (user choice)

And after that,
We will try to implement a singly linked list using waste from classroom materials:

```c++
struct Node {
    int value;
    Node* next;
}
```

The task itself:

In an endless loop, we create list items and in the Value field we write the number that the user enters, we do this until the user enters the number zero. In the course of passing through the loop, we link the elements to each other by the next pointer.
